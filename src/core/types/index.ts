 * Core Types Module

 * This module contains shared type definitions used across the application.
 * It provides a centralized location for common types, interfaces, and type guards
 * that are used by multiple features.
 * 
 * Out of scope:
 * - Feature-specific types (these belong in their respective feature modules)
 * - Implementation details (these belong in the infrastructure layer)
